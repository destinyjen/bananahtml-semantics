    <h1>Bananas</h1></b>
    <p>A <b>banana</b> is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry[1][2] – produced by several kinds of large
        herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.[3] In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called
        "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but
        is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow,
        red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow upward in clusters near the top of the plant. Almost all modern
        edible seedless (parthenocarp) bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The
        scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa × paradisiaca for the
        hybrid Musa acuminata × M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution. The old scientific name for this
        hybrid, Musa sapientum, is no longer used.</p>

    <h2>Etymology</h2>

    <p>The word "banana" is thought to be of West African origin, possibly from the Wolof word banaana, and passed into
        English via Spanish or Portuguese</p>

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>

    <p>The genus Musa was created by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.[33] The name may be derived from Antonius Musa, physician to
        the Emperor Augustus, or Linnaeus may have adapted the Arabic word for banana, mauz.[34] According to Roger
        Blench, the ultimate origin of musa is in the Trans–New Guinea languages, whence they were borrowed into the
        Austronesian languages and across Asia, via the Dravidian languages of India, into Arabic as a Wanderwort.[35]
        Musa is the type genus in the family Musaceae. The APG III system assigns Musaceae to the order Zingiberales,
        part of the commelinid clade of the monocotyledonous flowering plants. Some 70 species of Musa were recognized
        by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families as of January 2013;[33] several produce edible fruit, while
        others are cultivated as ornamentals.</p>
